# What is caffe?

Caffe is an open-source implementation of the recent convolutional algorithms that perform particularly well in large-scale image recognition tasks, such as [the ImageNet Challenges](http://www.image-net.org/). The purpose of caffe is to provide a reference implementation for such algorithms, and to enable wider adoption and analysis in the research community.

Caffe is written by Yangqing Jia at UC Berkeley as a replacement of [decaf](http://decaf.berkeleyvision.org/). It has then been adopted by several Berkeley vision group members and is under active development.
