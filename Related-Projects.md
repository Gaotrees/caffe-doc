## Projects Using Caffe

**Fast R-CNN** is a fast framework for object detection with deep ConvNets. Fast R-CNN
 - trains state-of-the-art models, like VGG16, 9x faster than traditional R-CNN and 3x faster than SPPnet,
 - runs 200x faster than R-CNN and 10x faster than SPPnet at test-time,
 - has a significantly higher mAP on PASCAL VOC than both R-CNN and SPPnet,
 - and is written in Python and C++/Caffe.
