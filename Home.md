# Wiki or Official docs?

The *official* documentation for Caffe is maintained and hosted by BVLC [here](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org).
This documentation is part of the Caffe source code repository and is meant to be an accurate reflection of the code.

This wiki hosts the *unofficial* part of the Caffe documentation, such as user-contributed examples and tips, links to blog posts and tutorials, a list of referencing publications, etc.

It is publicly-editable! Anyone logged into Github can change the content, so use this power only for good.
BVLC maintainers will periodically review the contents of the wiki. If you spot something that's wrong, feel free to make a note or adjust it yourself. Thanks!

**Tutorials**: BVLC and community guides to deep learning and the Caffe framework help with learning the ideas behind deep learning and the practical how-to knowledge of Caffe.

- [DIY Deep Learning for Vision: a Hands-On Tutorial with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit#slide=id.p) is the official tutorial by Evan Shelhamer, Jeff Donahue, Yangqing Jia, and Ross Girshick.
- [Intel / TAU Summer Workshop on Deep Learning and Caffe](http://courses.cs.tau.ac.il/Caffe_workshop/Bootcamp/) is a short course on deep learning and Caffe by Boris Ginzburg. It is detailed and complementary to the official tutorial, but not up-to-date with the current Caffe version. Refer to this for a close look at the forward and backward passes of common layer types.
