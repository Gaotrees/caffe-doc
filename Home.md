# Wiki or Official docs?

The *official* documentation for Caffe is maintained and hosted by BVLC [here](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org).
This documentation is part of the Caffe source code repository and is meant to be an accurate reflection of the code.

This wiki hosts the *unofficial* part of the Caffe documentation, such as user-contributed examples and tips, links to blog posts and tutorials, a list of referencing publications, etc.

It is publicly-editable! Anyone logged into Github can change the content, so use this power only for good.
BVLC maintainers will periodically review the contents of the wiki. If you spot something that's wrong, feel free to make a note or adjust it yourself. Thanks!
