# What is Caffe?

Caffe is an open-source implementation of the recent convolutional algorithms that perform particularly well in large-scale image recognition tasks, such as [the ImageNet Challenges](http://www.image-net.org/). The purpose of Caffe is to provide a reference implementation for such algorithms, contribute a framework for developing and deploying deep learning architectures for vision, and enable wider adoption and analysis in the research community.

Caffe was created by Yangqing Jia at UC Berkeley as a replacement of [decaf](http://decaf.berkeleyvision.org/). It has been adopted by several Berkeley vision group members and is under active development by the [Berkeley Vision and Learning Center](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu).
