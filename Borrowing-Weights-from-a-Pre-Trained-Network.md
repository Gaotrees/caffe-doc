# Weights

## What are Weights

Weights are learnable parameters in the network, which are tuned by the back propagation phase.

## Who Makes the Weights?

Weights are generated by caffe when your network in constructed. For example, this one layer (a fully connected layer) produces

    layer {
      name: "ip1"
      type: "InnerProduct"
      bottom: "pool2"
      top: "ip1"
      param {
        lr_mult: 1
      }
      param {
        lr_mult: 2
      }
      inner_product_param {
        num_output: 500
        weight_filler {
          type: "xavier"
        }
        bias_filler {
          type: "constant"
        }
      }
    }
