Here are a few notes of installation tries on Mac. Just for the record.

(Sergey and Yangqing) Maverick with the most recent clang does not work with caffe yet, due to libc++ problems.

(Sergio): when using OS 10.7.5 Lion, I needed to download OpenCV 2.4.5 instead of the latest, and MKL 2013 instead of the latest.
