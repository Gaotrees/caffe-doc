Trained models are posted here as links to Github Gists.
Check out the [model zoo help page](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html) for info.

Downloading models is not yet supported as a script (there is no good commandline tool for this right now), so simply go to the Gist URL and click "Download Gist" for now.
