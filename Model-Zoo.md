    Learning Deep Features for Scene Recognition using Places Database.
    Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 27 (NIPS) spotlight, 2014.

The project page is [here](http://places.csail.mit.edu)

### GoogLeNet GPU implementation from Princeton.
We implemented GoogLeNet using a single GPU. Our main contribution is an effective way to initialize the network and a trick to overcome the GPU memory constraint by accumulating gradients over two training iterations. 
* Please check [http://vision.princeton.edu/pvt/GoogLeNet/](http://vision.princeton.edu/pvt/GoogLeNet/) for more information. Pre-trained models on ImageNet and Places, and the training code are available for download.
* Make sure cls2_fc2 and cls3_fc have num_output = 1000 in the prototxt. Otherwise, the trained model would crash on test.

### <a name="fcn"></a>Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation (FCNs)

These models are described in the [paper](http://cs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf):

    Fully Convolutional Models for Semantic Segmentation
    Jonathan Long*, Evan Shelhamer*, Trevor Darrell
    CVPR 2015
    arXiv:1411.4038

Details, model definitions, pre-trained weights, and code are public on github: https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org.

These models are compatible with Caffe master, unlike earlier FCNs that required a pre-release branch (note: this reference edition of the models is still in progress and not all of the models have yet been ported to master). The models are available under the same license as the Caffe-bundled models (i.e., for unrestricted use; see http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html#bvlc-model-license).

### CaffeNet fine-tuned for Oxford flowers dataset
https://gist.github.com/jimgoo/0179e52305ca768a601f

The is the reference CaffeNet (modified [AlexNet](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks)) fine-tuned for the [Oxford 102 category flower dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). The number of outputs in the inner product layer has been set to 102 to reflect the number of flower categories. Hyperparameter choices reflect those in [Fine-tuning CaffeNet for Style Recognition on “Flickr Style” Data](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/finetune_flickr_style.html). The global learning rate is reduced while the learning rate for the final fully connected is increased relative to the other layers.

After 50,000 iterations, the top-1 error is 7% on the test set of 1,020 images.

Model:                                                                                                                                                                                          
[S2VT_VGG_RGB](https://gist.github.com/vsubhashini/38d087e140854fee4b14):                                                                                                                       
This is the S2VT (RGB) model described in the ICCV 2015 paper. It uses video frame features from the                                                                                            [VGG-16](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/211839e770f7b538e2d8#file-readme-md) layer model. This is trained only on the Youtube video dataset.

Compatibility:                                                                                                                                                                                  
These are pre-release models. They do not run in any current version of BVLC/caffe, as they require unmerged PRs. The models are currently supported  by the `recurrent` branch of the Caffe    fork provided at https://github.com/jeffdonahue/caffe/tree/recurrent and https://github.com/vsubhashini/caffe/tree/recurrent.


### ResNets: Deep Residual Networks from MSRA at ImageNet and COCO 2015

This repository contains the original models (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152) described in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). These models are those used in [ILSVRC] (http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/) and [COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#detections-challenge2015) 2015 competitions, which won the 1st places in: ImageNet classification, ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.

### Pascal VOC 2012 Multilabel Classification Model

This model has been used for the paper "Analyzing Classifiers: Fisher Vectors and Deep Neural Networks" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00172), which is to appear in the proceedings of CVPR 2016.
Kindly note, that it has been trained in a multilabel setting with a multilabel-compatible loss function. It should not be used in conjunction with a softmax layer
In particular $f_{i}(x)>0$ denotes presence of class i and multiple classes can be predicted in one image.

[[Webpage](http://cs-people.bu.edu/jmzhang/sod.html)]

The following models are finetuned on [the Salient Object Subitizing dataset](http://cs-people.bu.edu/jmzhang/sos.html) (~5000 images) with bounding box annotations:
 * [VGG16](https://gist.github.com/jimmie33/509111f8a00a9ece2c3d5dde6a750129): This model is used in the paper.
 * [GoogleNet](https://gist.github.com/jimmie33/339fd0a938ed026692267a60b44c0c58): This model is smaller, faster and slightly better than the VGG16 model.
