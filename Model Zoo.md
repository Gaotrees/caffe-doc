Trained models are posted here as links to Github Gists.
Check out the [model zoo documentation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/model_zoo.html) for details.

To acquire a model:

1. download the model gist by `./scripts/download_model_from_gist.sh <gist_id> <dirname>` to load the model metadata, architecture, solver configuration, and so on. (`<dirname>` is optional and defaults to caffe/models).
2. download the model weights by `./scripts/download_model_binary.py <model_dir>` where `<model_dir>` is the gist directory from the first step.

### Berkeley-trained models

 - [Finetuning on Flickr Style](https://gist.github.com/sergeyk/034c6ac3865563b69e60): same as provided in `models/`, but listed here as a Gist for an example.

### Network in Network model
The Network in Network model is described in the following [ICLR-2014 paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400):

please cite the paper if you use the models.

Models:
 * [NIN-Imagenet](https://gist.github.com/mavenlin/d802a5849de39225bcc6): a small(29MB) model for imagenet, yet performs slightly better than AlexNet, and fast to train.
 * [NIN-CIFAR10](https://gist.github.com/mavenlin/e56253735ef32c3c296d): NIN model on CIFAR10, originally published in the paper [Network In Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400). The error rate of this model is 10.4% on CIFAR10.

### Models used by the VGG team in ILSVRC-2014

The models are the improved versions of the models used by the VGG team in the ILSVRC-2014 competition. The details can be found on the [project page](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/) or in the following [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556):

    Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition
    K. Simonyan, A. Zisserman
    arXiv:1409.1556

Please cite the paper if you use the models.

Models:
 * [16-layer](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/211839e770f7b538e2d8#file-readme-md): 7.5% top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012-val, 7.4% top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012-test
 * [19-layer](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/3785162f95cd2d5fee77#file-readme-md): 7.5% top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012-val, 7.3% top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012-test

In the paper, the models are denoted as configurations `D` and `E`, trained with scale jittering.
The combination of the two models achieves 7.1% top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012-val, and 7.0% top-5 error on ILSVRC-2012-test.

#### Note
The models are currently supported by the `dev` branch, but are not yet compatible with `master`.
