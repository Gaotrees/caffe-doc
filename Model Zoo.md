Trained models are posted here as links to Github Gists.
Check out the [model zoo help page](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/dev/docs/model_zoo.md) for info.

Downloading models is not yet supported as a script (there is no good commandline tool for this right now), so simply go to the Gist URL and click "Download Gist" for now.
