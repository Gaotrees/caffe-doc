Trained models are posted here as links to Github Gists.
Check out the [model zoo help page](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/dev/docs/model_zoo.md) for info.

Downloading models is not yet supported as a script (there is no good commandline tool for this right now), so simply go to the Gist URL and click "Download Gist" for now.

### Berkeley-trained models

 - [Finetuning on Flickr Style](https://gist.github.com/sergeyk/034c6ac3865563b69e60): same as provided in `models/`, but listed here as a Gist for an example.

### Network in Network ImageNet model
 - [NIN-Imagenet](https://gist.github.com/mavenlin/d802a5849de39225bcc6): a small(29MB) model for imagenet, yet performs slightly better than AlexNet, and fast to train.

### Models from the BMVC-2014 paper "Return of the Devil in the Details: Delving Deep into Convolutional Nets"

The models are trained on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset. The details can be found in the following [BMVC-2014 paper](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2014/Chatfield14/):

    Return of the Devil in the Details: Delving Deep into Convolutional Nets
    K. Chatfield, K. Simonyan, A. Vedaldi, A. Zisserman
    British Machine Vision Conference, 2014 (arXiv ref. cs1405.3531)

Please cite the paper if you use the models.

#### Note
The models are currently supported by the `dev` branch, but are not yet compatible with `master`.
An example of how to use the models can be found in matlab/caffe/matcaffe_demo_vgg.m
