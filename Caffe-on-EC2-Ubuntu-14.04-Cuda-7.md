Here's a script which will install all caffe dependencies, download caffe, and test it.  This works with this [Ubuntu 14.04 AMI](http://thecloudmarket.com/image/ami-d05e75b8--ubuntu-images-hvm-ssd-ubuntu-trusty-14-04-amd64-server-20150325) (which, as of this writing, is the default ubuntu HVM image), and should be somewhat robust to updates.  It will install caffe wherever it is run; for the AMI, I ran it in the home directory for the ubuntu user.

If you want to use cudnn, you'll need a copy of cudnn-6.5-linux-x64-v2.tgz, in the same directory where the script is.

You can likely use this script for other ubuntu 14.04 installs, but you will probably want to get rid of the lines that set TMPDIR to /mnt.
