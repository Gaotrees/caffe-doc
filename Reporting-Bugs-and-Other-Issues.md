Bug reports and other issues are managed by the GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues). All are welcome to create issues on the tracker, but please search first to make sure the problem has not already been reported.

All discussion and inquiries aside from specific bugs and issues should be kept off the tracker; use the [caffe-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users) list instead, so that developers can maintain a clear and uncluttered view of bugs and issues.

When reporting a bug, it's most helpful to provide the following information, where applicable:
* What steps reproduce the bug?
* Can you reproduce the bug using the latest [master](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master), compiled with the `DEBUG` make option?
* What hardware and operating system/distribution are you running?
* If the bug is a crash, provide the backtrace (usually printed by Caffe; always obtainable with `gdb`).
